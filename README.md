# GoBEA
A Go library to make submissions to the BEA for data. Using this, a programmer will be able to 
make a request for data from the BEA for several different kinds of hosted data.  Since Go is a 
splended language and handles dependencies in an elegant manner, programmers will be able to create 
data driven applications for visualizing economic data and perform calculations with this data without
the headaches associated with Statistical Programs (R, Wolfram, etc.)

This is a hobby project, so be nice.
