# GoBEA
A Go library to make submissions to the BEA for data. Using this, a programmer will be able to 
make a request for data from the BEA for several different kinds of hosted data. 

This is a hobby project, so be nice.  


# Status 
I'm currently working on the build process which will allow for the user to compile the library with their own key to make requests, building a SendRequest function to send an HTTP request, and building a write method to allow for a user to write the requested data to file.
